# Extraction of Liver Vessel Systems From CT-Image


## About The Project


### Introduction

Extraction of the blood vessel system of a liver is a challenging task in the field of medical image processing. Normally, doctors must examine each slice manually to achieve accurate vessel segmentation. Our solution is called **Extraction of Liver Vessel Systems From CT-Image**, an automatic vessel segmentation. 

This is also a *scientific research* I and Duong, a friend of mine, conducted together. Here is the link to our paper [Extraction of Liver Vessel Systems From CT-Image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZSpyWUpRR0TInZEg4b-lZaciS8tsj_mM/view?usp=sharing).

This project is trained and evaluated on [the public IRCAD dataset.](https://www.ircad.fr/research/data-sets/liver-segmentation-3d-ircadb-01/)

### Built With

My application is built with these frameworks and tools:
* [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [NVIDIA Tesla P100 â€“ PCIE GPU (16 GB memory)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-p100/)
* [Tensorflow 2.6.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.6.0)
* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3712/)


## Getting Started

To get started, you should have prior knowledge on **Python** and **Tensorflow** at first. A few resources to get you started if this is your first Python or Tensorflow project:

- [Tensorflow: Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide)
- [Python for Beginners](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)


## Installation and Run

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/phkhanhtrinh23/vessel_segmentation.git
   ```
  
2. Use any code editor to open the folder **vessel_segmentation**.


## Step-by-step

1.  Run `preprocess_train_data.py` and `preprocess_valid_data.py` to *preprocess* and *generate* train and validation CT-Images, and then save them in the folder `./data/artery`.

2. Open the notebook `train.ipynb` and follow the pipeline in that notebook.

3. The folder `results` is the folder of pre-saved *weights* and *predictions* that I have trained and validated. Up till now, our best Dice Score is **79.6%**.

4. Enjoy!
